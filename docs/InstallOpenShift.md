The Aqua Security Operator is used to deploy and manage the Aqua Security platform and its components:
* Server (aka “console”)
* Database (optional, you can map an external database as well) 
* Gateway 
* Enforcer (aka “agent”)
* Scanner
* CSP (a simple package that contains the Server, Database, and Gateway)

Use the Aqua-Operator to: 
* Deploy the Aqua Security platform on OpenShift
* Scale-up Aqua Security components with extra replicas
* Assign metadata tags to Aqua Security components
* Automatically scale the number of Aqua scanners based on the number of images in the scan queue
	
The Aqua Operator provides a few [Custom Resources](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/tree/master/deploy/crds) to manage the Aqua platform. Please make sure to read the Aqua installation manual (https://docs.aquasec.com/docs) before using the Operator. 
For advanced configurations please consult with Aqua's support team.

  
## Prerequisites 
Make sure you have a license and access to the Aqua registry. If you want to obtain a new license, please contact us at https://www.aquasec.com/about-us/contact-us/.

## Deploy the Aqua Operator
1. Create a new namespace/project called 'aqua' for the Aqua deployment.
2. Install the Aqua Operator from RH's OperatorHub and add it to the 'aqua' namespace. The Operator will create a new service-account, called 'aqua-sa', to run the Aqua application. 

## Before You Deploy AquaCSP's Custom Resources 
You will need to supply two secrets for the installation - 
* A secret for the Docker registry
* A secret for the database

You can list the secrets in the Custom Resource YAML files or you can define them in the OpenShift project (see example below) -
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry aqua-registry --docker-server=registry.aquasec.com --docker-username=<AQUA_USERNAME> --docker-password=<AQUA_PASSWORD> --docker-email=<user email> -n aqua
oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua
oc secrets add aqua-sa aqua-registry --for=pull -n aqua
```
## Deploying the AquaCSP Custom Resource
There are multiple options to deploy the AquaCSP Custom Resource. You can review the different options in the following [file](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/operator_v1alpha1_aquacsp_cr.yaml).  
* The AquaCSP CRD defines how to deploy the Console, Database, Scanner, and Gateway. 
* You can instruct the AquaCSP CR to automatically deploy the Enforcer by setting the 'enforcer' and the 'enforcerMode' properties in the CR file. 
* If you want to deploy the Enforcers manually, you will need to first get a security token.  Access Aqua console and create a new Enforcer Group. Copy the group's 'token' and use it in the AquaEnforcer CR (see example below)
* You can instruct the AquaCSP CR to automatically deploy a Route by setting the 'route' property to 'true'.
* The default Service type for the console and gateway is ClusterIP. Please change if you want a different Service type.
* You can choose to install a different Aqua version by setting the 'version' property 
	
## Example 
Here is an example of a simple deployment  - 
```yaml
---
apiVersion: operator.aquasec.com/v1alpha1
kind: AquaCsp
metadata:
  name: aqua
  namespace: aqua
spec:
  infra:                                    
    serviceAccount: "aqua-sa"               
    namespace: "aqua"                       
    version: "4.6"                          
    requirements: true                      
  common:
    imagePullSecret: "aqua-registry"        # Optional: if already created image pull secret then mention in here
    dbDiskSize: 10       
    serverDiskSize: 4   
  database:                                 
    replicas: 1                            
    service: "ClusterIP"                    
  gateway:                                  
    replicas: 1                             
    service: "ClusterIP"                    
  server:                                   
    replicas: 1                             
    service: "ClusterIP" 
  enforcer:                                 # Optional: if defined the Operator will create the default Enforcer 
    enforcerMode: audit                     # Defines whether the default enforcer will work in 'enforce' or 'audit' more 
  route: true                               # Optional: if defines and set to true, the operator will create a Route to enable access to the console
```

If you haven't used the 'route' option in the AquaCSP CR, you should define a Route manually to enable external access to Aqua's console.

## Installing AquaEnforcer
If you haven't deployed the enforcer yet, or if you want to deploy additional enforcers, please follow the instruction below:
You can review the different options to implement AquaEnforcer in the following [file](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/operator_v1alpha1_aquaenforcer_cr.yaml).

Here is an example of a simple deployment  - 
```yaml
---
apiVersion: operator.aquasec.com/v1alpha1

    version: "4.6"                          # Optional: auto generate to latest version
  common:
    imagePullSecret: "aqua-registry"            # Optional: if already created image pull secret then mention in here
  deploy:                                   # Optional: information about aqua enforcer deployment
    image:                                  # Optional: if not given take the default value and version from infra.version
      repository: "enforcer"                # Optional: if not given take the default value - enforcer
      registry: "registry.aquasec.com"      # Optional: if not given take the default value - registry.aquasec.com
      tag: "4.6"                            # Optional: if not given take the default value - 4.5 (latest tested version for this operator version)
      pullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"            # Optional: if not given take the default value - IfNotPresent
  gateway:                                  # Required: data about the gateway address
    host: aqua-gateway
    port: 8443
  token: "<<your-token>>"                            # Required: enforcer group token also can use an existing secret instead (you can create a token from Aqua's console)
```
